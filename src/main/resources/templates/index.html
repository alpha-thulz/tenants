                    This is the <strong>Tenant Management System</strong> application template which I created as my training ground for
                    API testing, coming soon will be a <strong>Web</strong> and <strong>Android</strong> application.
                </p>

                    A few bugs and defects are left out deliberately, however some not on purposes, the aim is to uncover as many bugs as possible,
                    no fixes will be made.
